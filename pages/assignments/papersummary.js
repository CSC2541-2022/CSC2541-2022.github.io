          <h2>Paper Summary Assignment</h2>
          <h5>Due: October 31, at 11:59PM ET.</h5>

          <p>In the paper summary assignment, you will select and summarize four papers of your choosing from a list of suggested papers. In summarizing each paper, contextualize the paper within the research landscape, discuss the motivation and problem definition, the key approach of the paper - including the features that make it especially unique from other contemporary literature, and results/implications of the work for the community.</p>

          <p>Each summary should be roughly half a page using the provided LaTeX template. Some papers leave more to unpack and discuss than others, you’re welcome to have some summaries which are longer, and some which are shorter - however, your entire submission is to be at least two but not greater than three pages using the <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/neurips-2021/bfjnthbqvhgs" target="_blank">LaTeX template</a> (you do not need to include the title or authorship segments - since your name is included with your submission - if you would prefer to omit them to save on space).</p>

          {/*<p>If you’d like inspiration of how to summarize papers effectively, consider reading the following blog posts:</p>*/}
