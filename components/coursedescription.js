        <p>
        There is an increasing interest in using machine learning to solve problems in causal inference and the use of causal inference to design new machine learning algorithms. In this course, we will discuss the difference between statistical and causal estimands and introduce assumptions and models that allow estimating causal queries. It will be a mixed lecture/assignment/seminar/project-based course. Students will learn the basic concepts, nomenclature, and results in causality, along with advanced material characterizing recent applications of causality in machine learning. The motivating examples for the course material will be the application of machine learning to problems in healthcare. Students must have a strong background in probability theory, statistics, Bayesian networks, and familiarity with linear algebra and latent variable modeling.
